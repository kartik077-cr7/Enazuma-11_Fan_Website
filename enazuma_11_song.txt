Hey! Ho!
Stand up! Stand up if you love football!
Inazuma Eleven!
Tackle your fears with all your courage
Trust in your friends and you can win

No matter what the weather
It's sunny in our hearts
Kick off! the passes fly like lightning
Good ball! the tension is so exciting
We'll do our best together
Until the game is won
Whe we're together, we
practise to be strong
People put us down saying
we're the underdogs (Inazuma!)
The road to the final is long and hard
But none of these things matter when
We score a goal!

Stand up! Stand up if you love football!
Our passion for football
shines like lightning!
Stand up! Stand up if you love football!
Never give up until the final whistle
Stand up! Stand up if you love football!
Inazuma Eleven!
Inazuma! Hey
Inazuma! Here we go!
